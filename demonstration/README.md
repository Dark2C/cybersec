# Cybersecurity exam demonstration
In this video, I will show you two kinds of cyber-attacks.\
For the first type, I made two demos of DoS attack against an Ubuntu Server running an instance of Apache Webserver.\
The first demo is a SYN flood attack, that is based on a security weakness in the TCP protocol;\
The second demo is a Slowloris attack, an application level attack that aims to consume server resources using minimal bandwidth.\
The second kind of attack is an (extremely simplified version of an) Advanced Persistent Attack, that is made exploiting several attack vectors.\
In this example we will cover the following topics:
- Local file inclusion
- SQL injection (in the authentication bypass part)
- Unrestricted file upload (backdoor upload)
- Stored XSS
\

This demonstration was made for the cybersecurity exam of the University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”
